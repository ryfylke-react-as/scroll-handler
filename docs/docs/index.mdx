# Scroll Handler

> Create scroll effects with ease and performance in mind

## Install

```bash
npm i @ryfylke-react/scroll-handler
```

You can also alternatively copy/paste the source directly from [here](#source).

## Use

### Creating a new scroll handler

```typescript
import { ScrollHandler } from "@ryfylke-react/scroll-handler";

const scrollHandler = new ScrollHandler({
  target: document.querySelector("#app")!, // default: `document.body`
})
  .onScroll((event, { disable }) => {
    // Do something when scroll event is triggered
  })
  .enable();
```

You can call the `disable` util to disable the scroll handler.

### Adding conditional effects and breakpoints

```typescript
scrollHandler
  .between(0, 500, (event, { getPercent }) => {
    // Do something when scroll position is between 0 and 500
    const percent = getPercent();
  })
  .onceOver(500, () => {
    // Called once whenever scroll position goes from less than 500 to more than 500
  });
```

You can also pass elements as arguments to `between`, `onceOver` and `onceUnder`:

```typescript
const element = document.querySelector("#element")!;
scrollHandler
  .between(0, element, () => {
    // ...
  })
  .onceOver(element, () => {
    // ...
  });
```

This essentially uses the elements `getBoundingClientRect().top` to determine the value. This value
is cached, and uses a `MutationObserver` and debounced resize-listener to do it's best to update the
value whenever the element could have changed position.

If you know that the element will not change position, you could just pass the value.

```typescript
const elTop = document
  .querySelector("#element")!
  .getBoundingClientRect().top;
scrollHandler
  .between(0, elTop, () => {
    // ...
  })
  .onceOver(elTop, () => {
    // ...
  });
```

## Reference

### ScrollHandler arguments

```typescript
const options: {
  target?: HTMLElement; // default: document.body
} = {}; // optional

const handler = new ScrollHandler(options);
```

### ScrollHandler instance methods

- **onScroll**  
  `(effect: ScrollEffect) => this`  
  Send event to channel
- **between**  
  `(after: ScrollEventTarget, before: ScrollEventTarget, effect: ScrollEffect) => this`  
  Sets up conditional effect that runs between two scroll positions
- **onceOver**  
  `(after: ScrollEventTarget, effect: ScrollEffect) => this`  
  Sets up conditional effect that runs once when scroll position goes from less than to more than a given position
- **onceUnder**  
  `(before: ScrollEventTarget, effect: ScrollEffect) => this`  
  Sets up conditional effect that runs once when scroll position goes from more than to less than a given position
- **when**  
  `(condition: () => boolean, effect: ScrollEffect) => this`  
  Sets up conditional effect that runs when a given condition is met. Condition is checked on every scroll event.
- **enable**  
  `() => void`  
  Enables the scroll handler
- **disable**  
  `() => void`  
  Disables the scroll handler
- **goTo**  
  `(opts: GoToOptions) => this`  
  Scrolls to a given position

### ScrollHandler instance properties

- **scrollTop** `number`  
  The current scroll position
- **target** `HTMLElement`  
  The target element

### ScrollEffect

```typescript
type ScrollEffect = (
  event: Event,
  utils: {
    getPercent: () => number; // <- Only available when using `between`
    disable: () => void;
  }
) => void;
```

### ScrollEventTarget

```typescript
type ScrollEventTarget = HTMLElement | number;
```

## Use with React

If you are going to use this with React, you can install the `@ryfylke-react/scroll-handler-react` package.

```typescript
const App = () => {
  const targetElementRef = useRef<HTMLElement>(null);

  useScrollHandler({
    onScroll: [() => {
      // ...
    }]
    between: [
      {
        after: 0,
        before: targetElementRef,
        effect: () => {
          // ...
        }
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

This makes it easier to use ScrollHandler with React.
`ScrollEventTarget` is also extended to accept React refs, which is how you should pass elements to the hook.

## Q/A

- **My events are not firing when I scroll**  
  Make sure that you have called the `enable` method on the scroll handler instance.

  It could also be that you are not targetting the correct element. By default, the scroll handler targets `document.documentElement || document.body`.
  If you are using a custom scroll container, you should pass it as an argument when initializing the scroll handler.

  If you want to _listen_ on scroll on one element, but get the `scrollTop` from another, you should use `target` to specify the listener-element, and `getScrollTop` function to specify how to get the scrollTop:

  ```typescript
  const scrollHandler = new ScrollHandler({
    target: document.querySelector("main")!,
    getScrollTop: () =>
      document.querySelector("#app")!.scrollTop,
  });
  ```

  This is only for very specific use-cases, and you should probably not do this.

  **If you want the target to be the document body, you should not pass the `target` argument, or pass it as `undefined`**.
  This is because the scroll handler will use `document.documentElement || document.body` to get the `scrollTop` (unless you specify a `getScrollTop` function),
  but `document` to add the event listener. This is the most consistent way to do it for the "page scroll", and should work in all browsers.

- **My events are firing too often**  
  Make sure that you are not creating a new scroll handler instance on every render. This will cause the scroll handler to add a new event listener on every render, which will cause the events to fire more often than they should.

  Additionally, you can use a [debounce](https://decipher.dev/30-seconds-of-typescript/docs/debounce/) util to debounce the events.
